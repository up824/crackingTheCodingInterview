#6.6 Blue-Eyed Island
"""
interesting one
start from easiest case
1 blue: he would figure out he's the one at 1st night, so 1 day
2 blues: day 1 - both of them would suppose there's only one blue guy and he would leave the next day
         day 2 - both of them stay, then they figure out there are two blue in the island at the 2nd night
3 blues: 3 day
n blue -> n day
